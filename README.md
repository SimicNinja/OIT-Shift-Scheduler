# OIT-Shift-Scheduler

The project can be run with the CLI command `go run .` You can then access the service by browsing to `localhost:4444` in your preferred browser. It is **highly** recommended that you use the private/incognito mode of your browswer to prevent issues with the staging of the static files for the frontend.

Please note that student2 comes with a schedule that has already been selected and submitted for testing purposes. Also, the "Review Schedule" button in the admin view page must be clicked **twice** in order to populate the student's schedule (I ran out of time and couldn't debug this error).
